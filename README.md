# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! This space is where Iâ€™ll be documenting my journey through various modules of this DevOps bootcamp. Itâ€™s my central hub for all my notes, hands-on labs, and project work. Iâ€™m thrilled to share this adventure with you and excited to dive deep into the world of DevOps. Letâ€™s get started on this journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer! ðŸš€


## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple modules, each representing a core area of DevOps. You will find a dedicated folder for each module where  notes, labs, and any other relevant materials are stored.

## Sample Directory Structure

Here's how my directory structure is organised as I progress through the bootcamp. This is an example of what my repository might look like after completing a few modules:

### Modules

- **Linux:** Iâ€™ll start by learning both the basics and advanced concepts of Linux, which is the backbone of many DevOps tools.
- **Git:** Mastering version control with Git is crucial, so I'll focus on becoming proficient in this essential DevOps skill.
- **AWS:** I plan to dive into Amazon Web Services to get a solid grasp of managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Terraform:** Iâ€™ll automate my infrastructure using Terraform, a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
- **Kubernetes:** Exploring Kubernetes will be key for understanding container orchestration.
- **Docker:** Iâ€™ll delve into containerisation with Docker to streamline application deployment.
- **CI/CD:** Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines will be a core focus.
- **Networking:** Iâ€™ll build a strong foundation in networking to see how it integrates with DevOps practices.
